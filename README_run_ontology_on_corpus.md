# Build the tool

For building the entire tool chain for Ontology, just run below
command in directory `Ontology`:

```bash
# cd ontology
./pascali-setup.sh
```

# Running Ontology on sci-corpus

## Dependencies & prerequisites 

To run driver script `run-ontology-on-corpus.py`, you need first to
install below packages:

- pyYaml: `pip install pyyaml`

The driver script need python version higher than `2.7.10`.

### Regarding DLJC

We currently use a customized version of
[do-like-javac](https://github.com/pascaliUWat/do-like-javac.git). In
`pascali-setup.sh` we download this version of DLJC in the parent dir
of ontology.

You also need to install Lithium for the test case minimizer:
https://github.com/pascaliUWat/do-like-javac/blob/master/README_testminimizer.md


## Running the tool
To run ontology on sci-corpus, just run following command:

```bash
# cd ontology
python run-ontology-on-corpus.py
```

This script would first fetching the projects defined in
`projects.yml` from
[opprop-benchmarks](https://github.com/opprop-benchmarks) into
`ontology/corpus`, then running Ontology on this corpus.

After this script finished, you can check the `logs/infer.log` under
each project directory to see the tool running log, and
`logs/infer_result_*.jaif` are the inference output
of onology on each project.

### Regarding the sci-corpus

You may notice currently there were some projects has been commented
out in `projects.yml`, i.e. we are running on a sub-set of
sci-corpus. Most of those projects cannot compile (have basic java
compile issues), with two of them we still have problems to infer
results on them, and currently are working on fixing them.
